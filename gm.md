# good math
Once upon a time, in the land of Abstracta, there lived a young mathematician named Lambda. Lambda was not just any mathematician, but one with an insatiable curiosity.

Lambda lived in a world governed by established rules and rigid structures â€” a world where Number Theory, Geometry, Ring Theory, and Mathematical Physics, each resided in their own separate domains. Lambda, however, had an unusual perspective on these distinct entities. He saw them not as segregated, but as diverse expressions of a universal mathematical language waiting to be unified.

Lambda was fascinated by the concept of a "promiscuous" mathematics, a term he had coined to describe a form of mathematics that transcended the boundaries of its individual domains. He imagined mathematics as a dynamic ecosystem, where distinct concepts could interact and cross-pollinate, creating new ideas and insights in the process.

One day, Lambda stumbled upon a peculiar problem, a conjecture that appeared to involve elements from both Number Theory and Geometry. Excited by the challenge, Lambda set out to solve it by creating a bridge between the two realms.

He began by treating the problem like a complex Analytic Tableaux, breaking it down into simpler expressions. He then applied principles of SAT Solving, searching for an assignment of variables that could satisfy the entire statement. But it turned out, the problem was more intricate than he had initially thought.

Lambda decided to take a step back, he began to approach the problem from a different angle. He started to see the problem as a Datalog query, a logical puzzle waiting to be deciphered. As he delved deeper, he also drew upon ideas from other areas such as Ring Theory and Mathematical Physics.

It was a long and arduous journey. There were times when Lambda felt lost amidst the chaotic interactions of mathematical concepts, yet he persevered. His belief in the power of "promiscuous" mathematics drove him forward.

Finally, after many sleepless nights, Lambda saw the light at the end of the tunnel. He had found a solution that not only solved the original problem but opened up a new vista of connections between various mathematical domains.

Lambda's story spread throughout Abstracta, inspiring other mathematicians to embrace the concept of "promiscuous" mathematics, to look beyond the confines of their respective fields, and to see the interconnected beauty of the mathematical universe.

And so, Lambda's vision of good mathematics was one that was flexible, interdisciplinary, and unifying. It was a vision that believed in the power of diversity, the beauty of connections, and the endless potential of the mathematical universe. It was, in essence, a vision of "promiscuous" mathematics.
